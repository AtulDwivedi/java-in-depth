 ## Single Responsibility Principle  
 > A class should have only one reason to change.  
  
## Open Close Principle  
> Software entities like classes, modules and functions should be open for extension but closed for modifications.  
  
## Liskov's Substitution Principle  
> Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types.  
  
## Interface Segregation Principle  
> Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use.  
  
## Dependency Inversion Principle  
> - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.  
> - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
