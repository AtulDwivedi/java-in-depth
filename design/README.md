## Software Design Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have only one reason to change.### Single Responsibility Principle

### Open Close Principle
Software entities like classes, modules and functions should be open for extension but closed for modifications.

### Liskov's Substitution Principle
Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types.

### Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use.

### Dependency Inversion Principle
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
